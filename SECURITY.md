# Security Policy

Since the project is currently in development and is looking forward to reach its "proof of concept" stage, security is not the No.1 priority.

## Vulnerabilities

If you do find a vulnerability create an issue and we will try to resolve it at given time. Also, we would be happy to see contributions to the project, helping us to reach our goal!
